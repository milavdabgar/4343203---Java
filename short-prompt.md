Create simple GTU paper solutions for weak students who struggle with exams. I've uploaded a paper PDF.

MUST-FOLLOW RULES:

1. EXTREMELY SHORT ANSWERS:
   - 7 marks: Max 350 words
   - 4 marks: Max 200 words
   - 3 marks: Max 150 words
   - Don't explain steps that weak students won't understand

2. ALWAYS USE:
   - Bullet points instead of paragraphs
   - Simple language
   - Bold keywords
   - Diagrams/tables FIRST, then minimal text
   - Mnemonics where possible

3. FORMAT:
   - Question X(y): [text] (Marks: Z)
   - Answer X(y): [answer]
   - For OR questions: X(y OR)

I'll ask for solutions by typing:

- "Start" or "Question 1(a)" for the first
- "Next" for subsequent questions
