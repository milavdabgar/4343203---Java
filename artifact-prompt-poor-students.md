Create simple GTU paper solutions using a systematic artifact-based approach for weak students who struggle with exams. I've uploaded a paper PDF.

Create GTU paper solutions for very weak students using half the typical word count (3-mark: 50-60 words, 4-mark: 75-90 words, 7-mark: 125-150 words), maximizing diagrams and tables, using minimal bullet points with bold keywords, simple mnemonics, and extremely basic code examples with clear comments.

GUIDELINES FOR SOLUTION CREATION:

1. Artifact Naming Convention
- Create separate artifacts for each question and OR variations in BOTH English and Gujarati
- Format for English artifacts: `[subject-code]-[season]-[year]-question[number]`
- Format for Gujarati artifacts: `[subject-code]-[season]-[year]-question[number].gu`
- Examples:
  * English: `4343203-summer-2024-question1`, `4343203-summer-2024-question1-or`
  * Gujarati: `4343203-summer-2024-question1.gu`, `4343203-summer-2024-question1-or.gu`

2. FORMAT for English Question and Answer: 
  * Question X(y): [text] (Marks: Z) 
  * Answer X(y): [answer] 
  * For OR questions: X(y OR)

3. FORMAT for Gujarati Question and Answer:
  * પ્રશ્ન X(y): [text] (ગુણ: Z)
  * જવાબ X(y): [answer]
  * For OR questions: પ્રશ્ન X(y OR)

4. Content Requirements
- As this paper solution is intended for weak students, the word count criteria is strict to follow, do not exceed these limits in any case as weak students get overwhelmed and skip the question if it appears lengthy
- Word count guidance:
  * 3-mark questions: Approximately 100-120 words
  * 4-mark questions: Approximately 150-180 words
  * 7-mark questions: Approximately 250-300 words

5. Solution Structural Elements
   1. Give utmost importance to diagrams and tables. Whenever a part of answer can be explained using diagrams and tables, use them instead of text.
   2. After diagrams and tables use bullet points instead of paragraphs
   3. Each bullet point should have bold keywords that help students memorize which keywords are key in this particular answer
   4. Create memorable mnemonics to help students recall the answer
   5. Create code as minimal and simple as possible, as weak students struggle with coding

6. Gujarati Translation Guidelines
   - Do NOT translate word-for-word; adapt the content culturally
   - Use natural, conversational Gujarati as spoken by contemporary students
   - Keep all technical terms in English (programming terms, keywords, etc.)
   - Ensure the content flows naturally and doesn't sound like a direct translation
   - Use transliteration in Gujarati script that feels familiar to modern-day Gujarati speakers
   - Include all diagrams, tables, and visual elements in the Gujarati version identical to the English version
   - Ensure both English and Gujarati versions present the same level of detail and content

I'll ask for solutions by typing: "Start" or "Question 1(a)" for the first "Next" for subsequent questions
