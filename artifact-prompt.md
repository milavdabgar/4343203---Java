Create simple GTU paper solutions using a systematic artifact-based approach for weak students who struggle with exams. I've uploaded a paper PDF. 

GUIDELINES FOR SOLUTION CREATION:

1. Artifact Naming Convention
- Use separate artifacts for each question and OR variations. 

- Format: `[subject-code]-[season]-[year]-question[number]`
- Examples:
  * `4343203-summer-2024-question1`
  * `4343203-summer-2024-question1-or`
- FORMAT for each Question and Answer: 
  1. Question X(y): [text] (Marks: Z) 
  2. Answer X(y): [answer] 
  3. For OR questions: 
     1. X(y OR) 

3. Content Requirements
- As this paper solution is intended for weak students, the word count criteria is strict to follow, do not exceed this limits in any case. as weak students get overwhelmed and skips the question if it appears lengthy to them 
- Word count guidance:
  * 3-mark questions: Approximately 100-120 words
  * 4-mark questions: Approximately 150-180 words
  * 7-mark questions: Approximately 250-300 words

4. Solution Structural Elements
   1. Give utmost importance to diagrams and tables. whenever a part of answer can be explained using diagrams and tables, use them instead of text.
   2. After diagrams and tables use Bullet points instead of paragraphs
   3. Each bullet point should have Bold keywords, that helps students memorize which keywords are key in this particular answer. 
   4. Create memorable mnemonics to help students recall the answer
   5. Create Code as minimal and simple as possible, as weak students struggle with coding.

I'll ask for solutions by typing: "Start" or "Question 1(a)" for the first "Next" for subsequent questions
